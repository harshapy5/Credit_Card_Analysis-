# Credit_Card_Analysis-

The entire data cleaning and analysis has been done in MySQL:
Database name is creditcards and Table name is cc. The CSV file was imported into MySQL.

Data Cleaning :
There were no null values or missing values. Two changes were made to the column names.
Column name Card Type was changed to Card_Type and Exp Type was changed to Exp_Type for SQL analysis purpose.

Data Analysis:
The idea behind doing the analysis was to find some patterns or links which could help the credit card company in formulating certain strategies for decision making purposes. The questions have been formulated based on this.
